## Overview
This repository contains code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. The analysis includes insights into team performance, player statistics, and factors influencing match outcomes. The dataset used can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manasgarg/ipl).

## Files
- **deliveries.csv:** Dataset containing information about each delivery in IPL matches.
- **matches.csv:** Dataset containing information about each IPL match.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
## Installation  
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Code
1. Download the datasets ('deliveries.csv' and 'matches.csv') and place them in the same directory as the code file.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn`).
3. Run the code in a Python environment.
